# Character Suggestion Chips Feature

## Overview
The Character Suggestion Chips feature provides an intuitive and dynamic way to select personality traits for character creation. It uses a sophisticated system of related traits that expand organically from selected traits, creating a natural flow of character development.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Primary Trait Selection
- Traits are displayed as elegant, rounded chips with subtle shadows
- Each chip has a clean, minimal design with optional expansion indicators
- Chips are organized in a fluid, wrapping layout for optimal space usage
- Primary traits are displayed in the base theme color with a light background

### 2. Related Traits Expansion
When a trait is selected:
- 1-3 related traits smoothly expand outward from the selected chip's position
- Related traits appear with a subtle fade-in and scale animation
- Related traits are visually distinguished with:
  - A lighter background tint of the primary color
  - A slightly bolder font weight
  - A colored border to show relationship

### 3. Animation Behavior
- **Selection Animation**: 
  - Duration: 300ms
  - Timing: Curves.easeOutCubic for natural movement
  - Style: Expansion originates from the selected chip's position
  
- **Related Traits Animation**:
  - Appear sequentially from the parent trait
  - Smooth fade-in combined with upward expansion
  - No global refresh of other chips when selecting

### 4. Interaction States
- **Unselected State**:
  - Light background
  - Regular font weight
  - Subtle border
  - Optional expansion indicator

- **Selected State**:
  - Slightly elevated
  - Highlighted border
  - Expansion indicator active
  - Related traits visible

- **Related Trait State**:
  - Tinted background
  - Accent color text
  - Stronger border
  - No expansion indicator

### 5. Search Functionality
- Clean, minimal search field design
- Real-time filtering of available traits
- Maintains selected traits and their relationships
- Smooth animations when filtering results

## Visual Hierarchy
1. **Primary Level**: Main personality traits
2. **Secondary Level**: Direct related traits (1-3 suggestions)
3. **Visual Indicators**: 
   - Subtle shadows for depth
   - Color variations for relationships
   - Icon indicators for expandable traits

## Interaction Flow
1. User selects a primary trait
2. Related traits smoothly expand from the selection point
3. Each related trait can be selected to further define the character
4. Selected traits remain visible but visually distinct
5. Process continues, building a rich personality profile

## Technical Implementation
- Uses Material Design 3 for modern, consistent styling
- Implements custom animation controller for smooth transitions
- Maintains chip positions for natural expansion points
- Optimized for both touch and mouse interaction
- Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes

## Best Practices
- Keep animations subtle and purposeful
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy
- Ensure smooth performance with large trait sets
- Provide clear feedback for user interactions
- Keep the interface clean and uncluttered

## Accessibility
- Clear contrast ratios for text and backgrounds
- Adequate touch targets for all interactive elements
- Semantic labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Clear visual feedback for all interactions
