## I. Project Summary  
Read Leaf is a Flutter-based application designed to optimize the e-book reading experience while simplifying the process of searching, previewing, and downloading books. Most importantly, it enables users to deeply understand digital book content. The key differentiator of Read Leaf is its integration with advanced AI technology. Users can select text passages and instantly receive context-specific explanations, summaries, and answers via leading AI services such as Gemini, GPT, and Claude—all within the app. This addresses the growing demand for a unified, intelligent e-book reading solution, catering to book enthusiasts, students, and professionals seeking a more efficient way to engage with digital content.

## II. Problem Statement  
The current digital reading landscape is fragmented. Users face several challenges:  
- **Multiple Applications:** Managing digital libraries, searching for new books online, and using separate tools for AI-driven insights require multiple apps.  
- **Limited Features:** Many e-book readers lack advanced functionalities like comprehensive text search, effective annotations, and seamless online book searches.  
- **Interrupted Reading Flow:** Switching between a reading app and external AI tools disrupts the reading process and hampers productivity.
